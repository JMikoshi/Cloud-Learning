Learning Cloud and Git


## Hello

<p>My name is JMikoshi and I'm currently using Git as a way to learn Cloud.</p>
<p>I'm using this mainly to learn markdown in some different fashions to show what I have learned.</p>

I'm currently following this [guide](https://learntocloud.guide/phase1/versioncontrol).   

It is very __neat__ to learn such things.  

There are _variations_ to the ways we can learn.  

`echo this is not very intuitive at first but it's fun to learn`

<p> I'm trying to add more information but I will go through this project and add more to this repository as time goes on I cannot wait to get my feet wet with something that is new and exciting!</p>
