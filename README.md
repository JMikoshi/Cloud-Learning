Learning Cloud and Git


## Hello

<p>My name is JMikoshi and I'm currently using Git as a way to learn Cloud.<br>
I'm using this mainly to learn markdown in some different fashions to show what I have learned.<br>
I'm currently following this [guide](https://learntocloud.guide/phase1/versioncontrol).<br>
It is very **Neat** to learn such things.<br>
There are *variations* to the ways we can learn.</p>

`echo this is not very intuitive at first but it's fun to learn`
